            </h3>
            <p>The client must know what may be categorised as a revision or what may be categorised as an amendment. The revision will be considered if there will be any mistake conducted by a company member, either sales, support or expert. However, an amendment will be regarded as once the customer had not provided complete details or asking to make new additions, which was not mentioned earlier while placing the order. The charges will be based on the circumstance, and support member will guide you on this.

            </h3>
            <p>With our unlimited revision and amendment policy, you may change your instructions or add additional instructions as conveyed by your supervisor to meet all your requirements to your satisfaction. However, the amendments will cause additional charges which were not conveyed or placed before. In the event of double billing due to a processing error, failure to meet any of your requirements, or failure to meet the delivery requirements for your order, you will receive a full or partial refund.
            </p>
            <p>You can request a refund if you are not satisfied with the product or service delivered within 24 hours of receiving your order. A percentage refund will be given if we cannot provide the requested service due to our unlimited revision policy.
            </p>
            <p>If a refund request is not received within two days of delivery of the order, both parties will assume that the order has been fulfilled to your satisfaction. In case of discount offers, the Company is not liable to reimburse the money. Refunds are only applicable on the orders if the customer claims within 24 hours of the order’s delivery, whereas 72 hours are required to deliver revisions/amendments. Revisions can also be placed or claimed by the customer within 72 hours of the order’s delivery.
